# Addition of noise :
 ## 1. Addition of salt and pepper noise.
 Salt and pepper noise, is a kind of noise that is characterized by random bright 
 and dark spots all over the image. it is usually caused by the malfunctioning of
 the camera's sensor cells.
	
 prob - probablity of a pixel having salt and pepper noise in the image,
 it is used to change the intensity of the noise.
 
 ## 2. Addition of gaussian noise.
 Gaussian noise is a statistical noise having a probablity density function(PDF)
 equal to that of normal distribution. this noise arises in amplifier or detectors
