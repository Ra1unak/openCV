## 1. Arithmetic Mean Filtering:- <br/>
Arithmetic mean filter is the simplest of all the filters, It is a box filter 
where, if Sxy represents the set of pixels in a rectangular area of m * n, 
and the center point of Sxy is the point(x,y) the arithmetic mean filter
calculates the average value of the currupted area, i.e. Sxy and place the 
avg value at the center point (x,y). <br />
In mathematical terms it can be defined as :- <br/>

## 2. Arithmetic Median Filtering:- <br/>
Arithmetic median is a box filter where, if Sxy represents the set of pixels 
in a rectangular area of m * n, and the center point of Sxy is the point(x,y) 
the arithmetic mean filter calculates the median value of the currupted area, 
i.e. Sxy and place the median value at the center point (x,y). <br />


## 3. Min Filtering:- <br/>
Arithmetic median is a box filter where, if Sxy represents the set of pixels 
in a rectangular area of m * n, and the center point of Sxy is the point(x,y) 
the min filter calculates the min pixel value of the currupted area, i.e. Sxy 
and place the min value at the center point (x,y). <br />

## 3. Max Filtering:- <br/>
Arithmetic median is a box filter where, if Sxy represents the set of pixels 
in a rectangular area of m * n, and the center point of Sxy is the point(x,y) 
the Max filter calculates the min pixel value of the currupted area, i.e. Sxy 
and place the Max value at the center point (x,y). <br />
